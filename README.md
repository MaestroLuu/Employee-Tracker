# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This application allows clients to create an employee database by utilizing the client's responses to a series of prompt displayed in the command terminal. After completing the prompts, the client will be able to view all employees within their database, add new employees, roles, departments, and update employee information.

## Installation

In order for the application to function properly, users must install both inquirer to run the prompt and jest to run the tests. Users can install this package by going into their terminal and typing in "npm i inquirer" and "npm i jest".

## Usage

To use this application, clients must first install the npm packages "inquirer", "Console.table", and "mysql2" to properly run the script. In addition, they must also have MySQL installed on their computer to access the schema and seeds provided. After sourcing the schema.sql and seeds.sql, clients can type "node server.js" into the terminal and the series of prompts will display. Clients can select which options they wish to interact with and can view their changes by selecting the "view all employees/roles/departments" option.
